# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository showcases my work in machine learning, time series forecasting, and financial analytics.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Data Analyst with 3+ years of experience building data-driven solutions for business optimization. I specialize in Python, machine learning, and creating actionable insights from complex datasets. Currently working at Webster Pacific LLC, where I develop analytical tools for inventory management, financial forecasting, and business intelligence.

**Technical Skills:**
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, JavaScript (AppScript)
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, GeoPandas, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning:** Time Series Forecasting, Anomaly Detection, Supervised/Unsupervised Learning
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Folium, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Git, Jupyter, Excel, Google Sheets, VS Code

## 📁 Projects

### 1. [Inventory Optimization & Demand Forecasting](./inventory-forecasting/)
*Status: In Progress | Last Updated: February 2026*

**Problem:** Businesses struggle with balancing inventory levels - too much inventory ties up cash, too little causes stockouts and lost sales.

**Solution:** Built an end-to-end demand forecasting system that predicts future inventory needs using historical sales data, seasonal patterns, and machine learning.

**Key Features:**
- Time series analysis with seasonal decomposition (SARIMA, Prophet)
- Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for multi-step forecasting
- Geographic demand pattern analysis using Folium
- Interactive Tableau dashboard for stakeholder insights
- ROI calculator showing cost savings from optimized inventory levels

**Results:**
- Reduced inventory carrying costs by X% (in development)
- Prevented stockouts with X% accuracy in demand prediction
- Identified seasonal patterns leading to Y% improvement in procurement timing

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Prophet, XGBoost, Folium, Tableau

### 2. [Cash Flow Forecasting & Anomaly Detection](./cashflow-forecasting/)
*Status: In Progress | Last Updated: February 2026*

**Problem:** Unpredictable cash flow creates financial risk and makes strategic planning difficult. Manual anomaly detection is time-consuming and error-prone.

**Solution:** Developed an ML-powered system that predicts future cash flow with high accuracy and automatically detects unusual financial patterns.

**Key Features:**
- LSTM/RNN neural networks for multi-period cash flow forecasting
- Isolation Forest algorithm for automated anomaly detection
- Real-time alerting system for unusual patterns
- Interactive Plotly visualizations for scenario analysis
- Monte Carlo simulation for risk assessment and stress testing

**Results:**
- Achieved 90%+ forecasting accuracy (in development)
- Automated detection of X anomalies that required manual review
- Enabled proactive cash management with Y-day advance warning

**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Pandas, NumPy

## 🎯 Project Development Approach

All projects in this portfolio follow a structured data science methodology:

1. **Business Understanding** - Define the problem and success metrics
2. **Data Collection & Cleaning** - Gather and prepare data for analysis
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Identify patterns, trends, and relationships
4. **Feature Engineering** - Create meaningful variables for modeling
5. **Model Development** - Build and train machine learning models
6. **Validation & Testing** - Evaluate model performance rigorously
7. **Deployment & Documentation** - Create usable tools with clear documentation
8. **Impact Measurement** - Quantify business value and ROI
